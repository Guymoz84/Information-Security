At the small dead zone, the code will be written in 635 and will jump to 0x5CD. The jump in patch1.asm is relative from the address of the jump order.
At patch2.asm, I first checked if the first character is # - if not, returned back to regular code and continue. Second, I checked if the next character(if we found a #) is ! and if so - call the system function as asked - and corrected the arguments(without #!) so when calling system, the two characters will not be a part of the arguments.
After system function returns, I jumped back, after the printf function, as wished - the jumps are at the big dead zone - I ensured the calls to jump by putting those orders around the middle of the dead zone.

As seen in q2 and in patch2, I added nops for ensuring the jump to be at my new code.
