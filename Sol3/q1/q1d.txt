After calling the validate function, there is a test operation.
By changing the opcode of test to cmp, we will get an operation of cmp eax,eax. At this situation, eax=eax. In addition, as the same way, I changed the opcode of jnz to jz.
After this to changes, the program will always decide that the message is valid.
(opcode of test is 85, cmp to registers is 39, jnz is 75 - changed to 74=jz)
