This program gets an input as a string: can be a pointer to a string, address, a string.
The input is stored in the ESI register.

The program returns the number of bytes that are not all zero: a byte is 8 bits, so the program counts how many bytes are not equal to '00000000'. The program will pass byte after byte, untill the null char: '\0'(which is stored in the ECX register).
